flexiblelink_analytical.m

This MATLAB script is an analytical tool designed to investigate the mode shapes of a clamped-free beam subjected to an applied moment at the free end, leveraging the principles of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The script makes use of MATLAB's symbolic computation capabilities, allowing for the derivation and solution of the beam's differential equation under specific boundary conditions. Here's a detailed explanation tailored for both students and experts in the field:

Script Breakdown
Symbolic Variables and Parameters
matlab
Copy code
syms w(x) C1 C2 C3 C4 EI L M0
assume(EI > 0);
assume(L > 0);
assume(M0, 'real');
The script starts by defining symbolic variables for the beam's deflection w(x), integration constants C1 to C4, the beam's flexural rigidity EI, length L, and an external applied moment M0 at the beam's free end. Assumptions are set to ensure physical feasibility: EI and L are positive, and M0 is a real number, reflecting realistic conditions of a beam.

Differential Equation Formulation
matlab
Copy code
diffEq = EI*diff(w, x, 4) == 0;
This line formulates the differential equation based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, which states that the product of the beam's flexural rigidity EI and the fourth derivative of the deflection w(x) with respect to the beam's longitudinal axis x equals zero, under the assumption of no distributed load.

Solving the Differential Equation
matlab
Copy code
wSol(x) = dsolve(diffEq);
The differential equation is solved using MATLAB's dsolve function. This step provides a general solution wSol(x) that includes arbitrary constants C1 through C4, which will later be determined by applying specific boundary conditions.

Applying Boundary Conditions

BCs = [subs(wSol, x, 0) == 0, ...
       subs(diff(wSol, x), x, 0) == 0, ...
       subs(EI*diff(wSol, x, 2), x, L) == M0, ...
       subs(EI*diff(wSol, x, 3), x, L) == 0];
Boundary conditions for a clamped-free beam are applied here. At the clamped end (x=0), the deflection and its first derivative (slope) are zero, reflecting no displacement or rotation. At the free end (x=L), the moment equals M0, and shear force (third derivative of w) is zero. These conditions are crucial for finding the actual physical behavior of the beam under given constraints.

Solving for Constants

This step solves for the constants C1 through C4 using the previously defined boundary conditions, effectively customizing the general solution to the specific problem at hand.

Substituting Constants into the General Solution
matlab
Copy code
modeShape = subs(wSol, constants);
Substitutes the solved values of the constants back into the general solution, yielding the specific mode shape of the beam under the defined boundary conditions and applied moment.

Boundary Value Problem (BVP) Solution
The code sets up and solves a boundary value problem (BVP) to find the beam deflection under a given load. This involves defining a mesh of points along the length of the beam (xmesh), an initial guess for the solution (solinit), and then using MATLAB's bvp4c function to solve the BVP. The differential equations (beamODE) and boundary conditions (beamBC) defined in separate functions are passed as arguments to bvp4c.

It exemplifies a systematic approach to modeling, simulation, and analysis that is critical in robotics and control engineering.

For the Simulink simulation 'acrobot_zerodynamics_simulink_control.slx', first run the 'acrobot_parameters.m'file.
