flexiblelink_analytical.m

This MATLAB script is an analytical tool designed to investigate the mode shapes of a clamped-free beam subjected to an applied moment at the free end, leveraging the principles of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The script makes use of MATLAB's symbolic computation capabilities, allowing for the derivation and solution of the beam's differential equation under specific boundary conditions. Here's a detailed explanation tailored for both students and experts in the field:

Script Breakdown
Symbolic Variables and Parameters
matlab
Copy code
syms w(x) C1 C2 C3 C4 EI L M0
assume(EI > 0);
assume(L > 0);
assume(M0, 'real');
The script starts by defining symbolic variables for the beam's deflection w(x), integration constants C1 to C4, the beam's flexural rigidity EI, length L, and an external applied moment M0 at the beam's free end. Assumptions are set to ensure physical feasibility: EI and L are positive, and M0 is a real number, reflecting realistic conditions of a beam.

Differential Equation Formulation
matlab
Copy code
diffEq = EI*diff(w, x, 4) == 0;
This line formulates the differential equation based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, which states that the product of the beam's flexural rigidity EI and the fourth derivative of the deflection w(x) with respect to the beam's longitudinal axis x equals zero, under the assumption of no distributed load.

Solving the Differential Equation
matlab
Copy code
wSol(x) = dsolve(diffEq);
The differential equation is solved using MATLAB's dsolve function. This step provides a general solution wSol(x) that includes arbitrary constants C1 through C4, which will later be determined by applying specific boundary conditions.

Applying Boundary Conditions
matlab
Copy code
BCs = [subs(wSol, x, 0) == 0, ...
       subs(diff(wSol, x), x, 0) == 0, ...
       subs(EI*diff(wSol, x, 2), x, L) == M0, ...
       subs(EI*diff(wSol, x, 3), x, L) == 0];
Boundary conditions for a clamped-free beam are applied here. At the clamped end (x=0), the deflection and its first derivative (slope) are zero, reflecting no displacement or rotation. At the free end (x=L), the moment equals M0, and shear force (third derivative of w) is zero. These conditions are crucial for finding the actual physical behavior of the beam under given constraints.

Solving for Constants
matlab
Copy code
constants = solve(BCs, [C1, C2, C3, C4]);
This step solves for the constants C1 through C4 using the previously defined boundary conditions, effectively customizing the general solution to the specific problem at hand.

Substituting Constants into the General Solution
matlab
Copy code
modeShape = subs(wSol, constants);
Substitutes the solved values of the constants back into the general solution, yielding the specific mode shape of the beam under the defined boundary conditions and applied moment.

Displaying and Plotting the Mode Shape
matlab
Copy code
disp('Mode Shape Equation with Modified Boundary Conditions:');
disp(modeShape);

fplot(subs(modeShape, {EI, L, M0}, {69e9 * (6.35e-3)^4 / 12, 1, 10}), [0, 1]);
Finally, the script displays the derived mode shape equation and plots it for given values of EI, L, and M0. This visual representation aids in understanding how the beam deflects along its length due to the applied moment at the free end.

Tailored Explanation
For Students: This script is a practical demonstration of applying theoretical knowledge from structural mechanics to solve real-world engineering problems using computational tools. It shows how to transition from the abstract formulation of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to a concrete solution that describes the physical behavior of a structural element under specific constraints. Understanding this process is crucial for aspiring engineers and scientists who wish to apply mathematical models to design and analyze mechanical systems.

For Experts: This code exemplifies the power of symbolic computation in MATLAB for solving complex differential equations arising in structural dynamics and mechanical engineering. By seamlessly integrating theoretical formulations with computational algorithms, it offers a robust framework for exploring the vibrational characteristics of beams and other structural elements. The methodology outlined here can be extended to more complex systems and loading conditions, providing a foundation for advanced research and development in the field of structural analysis and design.

flexiblelink_BVP.m

The provided MATLAB code defines a function named flexiblelink_BVP that solves a boundary value problem (BVP) for a clamped-free beam subjected to an applied moment at the free end. This problem is typical in structural mechanics, illustrating the deflection of beams under certain loading conditions. The solution is achieved through MATLAB's built-in boundary value problem solver bvp4c. Let's dissect the code for both students and experts in the field.

Code Explanation
Beam Properties Definition
matlab
Copy code
L = 1; % Length of the beam in meters
EI = 69e9 * (6.35e-3)^4 / 12; % Young's modulus times moment of inertia
M0 = 10; % Applied moment at the free end (N*m)
Here, the beam's physical properties are specified: L is the length, EI represents the flexural rigidity (product of Young's modulus and the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section), and M0 is the moment applied at the free end of the beam. These parameters are essential for modeling the beam's behavior under load.

Differential Equation Function
matlab
Copy code
function dydx = beamODE(x,y)
    dydx = [y(2); y(3); y(4); 0]; % Since EI*w'''' = 0
end
This nested function beamODE represents the system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) equivalent to the fourth-order beam differential equation (Euler-Bernoulli beam theory). In this context, y is a vector where y(1) represents the deflection w, and y(2), y(3), and y(4) are the first, second, and third derivatives of w, respectively.

Boundary Conditions Function
matlab
Copy code
function res = beamBC(ya,yb)
    res = [ya(1); ya(2); EI*yb(3) - M0; yb(4)];
end
The beamBC function specifies the boundary conditions at both ends of the beam. For the clamped end at x=0, the deflection (ya(1)) and slope (ya(2)) are zero. At the free end (x=L), the moment (EI*yb(3)) equals M0, and the shear force (yb(4), related to the third derivative of deflection) is zero.

Solving the Boundary Value Problem
matlab
Copy code
xmesh = linspace(0, L, 100);
solinit = bvpinit(xmesh, [0 0 0 0]);
sol = bvp4c(@beamODE, @beamBC, solinit);
An initial mesh along the beam's length and an initial guess for the solution are set up. The bvp4c function is then used to solve the boundary value problem defined by beamODE and beamBC, with the initial guess solinit.

Plotting the Solution
matlab
Copy code
x = linspace(0, L, 100);
y = deval(sol, x);
figure;
plot(x, y(1,:), 'LineWidth', 2);
Finally, the deflection of the beam is plotted along its length. The deval function evaluates the solution at points specified by x, and the first row of y (y(1,:))—representing the beam's deflection—is plotted.

flexiblelinkmodes.m

This MATLAB script calculates and visualizes the modal frequencies of a clamped-free beam with a square cross-section, made of aluminum, using the characteristic equation method. It's a great example of applying theoretical concepts from vibrations and structural dynamics in a computational environment. Let's break down the code for clarity for both students and experts in the field.

Code Breakdown
Beam Properties Definition
matlab
Copy code
L = 1;
a = 6.35e-3;
I = a^4 / 12;
A = a^2;
rho = 2700;
E = 69e9;
The script starts by defining the physical properties of the beam: its length (L), the dimensions of its square cross-section (a), material density (rho), and Young's modulus (E). From these, it calculates the moment of inertia (I) and the cross-sectional area (A), which are essential for further calculations.

Calculation of EI and rho*A
matlab
Copy code
EI = E * I;
rhoA = rho * A;
EI (flexural rigidity) and rho*A (mass per unit length) are calculated, which are key parameters in determining the beam's vibrational characteristics.

Characteristic Equation for Clamped-Free Beam
matlab
Copy code
charEq = @(k) cos(k*L).*cosh(k*L) + 1;
The characteristic equation relates the wave number k to the beam's length and boundary conditions. For a clamped-free beam, the roots of this equation determine the natural frequencies of vibration.

Finding Roots Numerically
matlab
Copy code
for n = 1:5
    kGuess = (2*n-1)*pi/(2*L);
    k(n) = fsolve(@(k) charEq(k), kGuess, options);
The script uses a numerical solver, fsolve, to find the first five roots of the characteristic equation. An initial guess is provided for each root based on the expected distribution of roots for a clamped-free beam.

Calculating Modal Frequencies
matlab
Copy code
    omega(n) = sqrt(EI/rhoA) * k(n)^2;
    f(n) = omega(n) / (2*pi);
For each root k, the script calculates the angular frequency omega and the frequency in Hertz f, using the relationship between wave number, EI, rhoA, and the properties of circular motion.

Displaying Results
matlab
Copy code
fprintf('Mode %d: k = %.4f rad/m, \omega = %.4f rad/s, f = %.4f Hz\n', n, k(n), omega(n), f(n));
The modal frequencies are displayed in a readable format, showing the wave number, angular frequency, and frequency for each mode.

Plotting Modal Frequencies
matlab
Copy code
plot(k, f, 'o-', 'Color', 'blue', 'MarkerSize', 8, 'LineWidth', 2);
Finally, a plot of modal frequencies against wave numbers provides a visual representation of the relationship between these quantities.

flexiblelinkvibration_FDM.m

This MATLAB script simulates the vibration of a clamped-free beam with an applied tip load and boundary disturbance using the Finite Difference Method (FDM). It includes the dynamic visualization of the beam's displacement over time and records this animation as a video. Let's unpack the script for a comprehensive understanding tailored to both students and experts.

Script Overview
Beam Properties and Initial Setup
The script begins by defining the beam's physical properties, including length, cross-sectional dimensions, material properties (density and Young's modulus), and calculates derived properties like the moment of inertia and area. These parameters are crucial for analyzing the beam's structural behavior.

Simulation Parameters
Next, parameters for the spatial (nx) and temporal (nt) resolution of the simulation, as well as the total simulation time (tf), are established. These determine the granularity and duration of the simulation.

Mesh Spacing and Time Step Calculation
Calculates dx and dt to define the spatial and temporal increments for the simulation, essential for the discretization in the FDM approach.

Initial Conditions
Imposes an initial deflection caused by a tip payload (P) across the beam, using a simple static deflection formula. This step sets the starting point for the dynamic simulation.

Damping, Payload, and Other Parameters
Defines additional parameters such as damping ratio (ksi), mass of the tip payload (Ms), and a damping coefficient (alpha) to incorporate damping effects into the simulation.

Boundary Disturbance
Creates a time-varying boundary disturbance (d) function to simulate external forces acting on the system, adding complexity to the vibrational behavior.

Main Loop for FDM
The core of the script, where the FDM is applied to solve the beam's vibration equation iteratively for each time step. It incorporates both the beam's physical properties and the boundary conditions to update the displacement values.

Visualization
Generates a 3D mesh plot of the beam's displacement over time, providing a visual overview of the entire simulation.

Video Recording Setup
Prepares a video writer object to record the dynamic simulation, specifying the format and frame rate for the output video.

Animation and Recording
Iterates through time steps at a specified interval (skipFrames), updating and plotting the beam's displacement at each frame. Each plot is captured and written to the video file, creating a time-lapse animation of the beam's vibration.
